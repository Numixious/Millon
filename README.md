# Millon Personality Assessment (MCMI) Web Application

This is an interactive web application that allows users to take a version of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) test. The application scores the test, collects basic user information, and leverages the **Google Gemini API** to generate a detailed, professional personality analysis report. The final report can also be downloaded as a PDF.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a Google Gemini API key to run this application.

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Click "Create API key" and copy your key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/millon-personality-assessment.git
    cd millon-personality-assessment
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Set up the API Key:**
    The application is configured to use an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`. For local development, you will need a tool that can substitute this variable, as a simple static file server will not work out-of-the-box.

    A recommended approach is to use a simple development server like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). If you were to adapt this project to use Vite:
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project.
    - Add your API key to the `.env` file:
      ```
      VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
      ```
    - You would then need to update `services/geminiService.ts` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` instead of `process.env.API_KEY`.

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this project is set up to run without a build step, you can serve the `index.html` file using any local web server. A common choice is the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.

    Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in server:
    ```sh
    # If you have Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`. You will need to manually replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your key for this method to work.

##  flowchart How It Works

1.  **Introduction**: The user is greeted with an introductory page and starts the test.
2.  **Questionnaire**: The user answers 175 "yes" or "no" questions. The UI tracks their progress.
3.  **User Info**: After completing the questionnaire, the user enters basic information to personalize the report.
4.  **Scoring**: The application calculates the raw scores and transforms them into clinically relevant Base Rate (BR) scores based on the `SCORING_KEY`.
5.  **AI Analysis**: The BR scores are formatted into a detailed prompt. A request is sent to the Google Gemini API, asking for a structured JSON response containing different sections of the personality analysis (e.g., Profile Summary, Validity, Recommendations).
6.  **Display Results**: The structured response from the Gemini API is parsed and displayed in a professional report format, complete with a BR score chart.
7.  **PDF Download**: The user can download the entire report as a PDF, which is generated by capturing the report element from the DOM.
